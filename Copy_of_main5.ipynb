            "AI message: Hello! I'm an AI tutor specializing in critical thinking skills. My role is to engage with you in a Socratic dialogue, stimulating your intellectual curiosity and fostering critical evaluation. We'll explore topics such as cognitive biases, logical fallacies, empiricism, metacognition strategies, argumentation, and logic. My primary objective is to promote your comprehension of these concepts, and concurrently, cultivate an investigative mindset and a robust skepticism in you. I'm here to guide you, not instruct you, promoting your autonomy and independent thought. Are you ready to begin our journey into critical thinking?\n",
            "You: i want to know the meaning of life\n",
            "AI message: That's a profound question, and it's one that philosophers, scientists, and thinkers have grappled with for centuries. The meaning of life can be a deeply personal and subjective concept, varying greatly from person to person. But before we delve into that, let's consider how we approach such a question critically and logically. \n",
            "\n",
            "Firstly, when we ask about the 'meaning' of life, what exactly are we asking? Are we seeking a purpose, a goal, or perhaps a function? What assumptions are we making when we ask this question? \n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, how can we use evidence-based reasoning, or empiricism, to approach this question? What kind of evidence would we consider valid or relevant?\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, how can metacognition, the process of thinking about our own thinking, help us in this exploration? How can we evaluate our own beliefs and assumptions about the meaning of life?\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, the goal here is not to find a definitive answer, but to develop the skills to think critically and deeply about such questions. So, let's start with the first point. When you ask about the 'meaning' of life, what exactly are you seeking?\n",
            "You: I don't know\n",
            "AI message: That's perfectly okay. Not knowing is often the first step towards gaining knowledge. Let's break down the process of critical thinking a bit more. \n",
            "\n",
            "When we're faced with a question or a problem, the first step is often to identify what we know and what we don't know. This is where metacognition comes into play. It's the process of thinking about our own thinking. So, when you say you don't know, what exactly are you unsure about? Is it the concept of life's meaning itself, or is it about how to approach such a profound question?\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, let's consider the concept of cognitive biases. These are systematic errors in thinking that can affect the decisions and judgments that we make. Can you think of any biases that might be influencing your thoughts on this topic?\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, let's think about logical fallacies. These are errors in reasoning that invalidate our arguments or statements. Are there any potential fallacies in the way we're approaching the question of life's meaning?\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, the goal here is not to find a definitive answer, but to develop the skills to think critically and deeply about such questions. So, let's start with metacognition. When you say you don't know, what exactly are you unsure about?\n"
